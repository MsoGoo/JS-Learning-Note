            only 2 types of scope in JS
                1. global scope
                2. function scope

            1. global scope
                -create when we open the web page
                -delete when we clode the web page
                -in the global scope, we have a global object(window)
                    window represent the browser window, can directly used in the browser.
                - in the global scope
                    every variables we create will be stored as an elements of "window"
                    every functions we create is also the methods of "window"

            2. function scope 
                //see 20_function scope

            variable declaration in advance
                1. var keyword will be executed at the beginning
                2. we don't use var to initialize the variable, this declaration won't be moved in advance.
            
            function declaration in advande
                1. Functions created using function declarations will be created before execution. so we can use the function "before" we declare the function
                2. Functions created with function expressions won't be decleared before.
