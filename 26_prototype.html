        /* 
            everytime we create a function, the parser will add an element(prototype) into the function

            each function has unique prototype

            prototype corresponding to an object, this object is prototype

            if it's just a normal function, prototype means nothing 

            when the function is constructor, each object created by this constructor will have an element  point to the prototype

            prototype object like a public area every variables intialized with the same class can access the constructor's prototype

            with prototype, we can Set the content of the object uniformly into the prototype

            when first access the object's elements, it will first search it's own scope. if we don't find this elements, then go search the prototype. 

            for consturctors, we can store the public methods and elements into the prototype.
